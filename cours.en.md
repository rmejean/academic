### Environment, societies, territories

**2017, 2018, 2019** · 62 hours · [UT2J](https://geo.univ-tlse2.fr/accueil-geo/accueil-departement-de-geographie-amenagement-et-environnement-9905.kjsp), L1, Toulouse (France)

Presentation of society-environment interactions in the broad sense. Major thematic issues are addressed with students through case studies: global warming, biodiversity, water resources, risk management, etc.

### The map: history, uses, commentary

**2017, 2018, 2019** · 75 hours · [UT2J](https://geo.univ-tlse2.fr/accueil-geo/accueil-departement-de-geographie-amenagement-et-environnement-9905.kjsp) L1, Toulouse (France)

Introduction to cartography. The objective is to familiarize students with topographic maps and guide them towards map commentary, from the study of maps at different scales, relating to different types of territories: urban, rural, mountain, coastal, etc..
The evolution of techniques and uses of maps from antiquity to present day is discussed (history of cartography).
Finally, a field trip in the streets of Toulouse allows students to make the link between the map and the field and to study the organization of urban space.

### Aerial photography and numeric cartography

**2017, 2018, 2019** · 75 hours · [UT2J](https://geo.univ-tlse2.fr/accueil-geo/accueil-departement-de-geographie-amenagement-et-environnement-9905.kjsp) L2, Toulouse (France)

Introduction to remote sensing through the photo-interpretation of IGN aerial photographs.
The history of vertical photography (from Nadar to current satellites) is discussed before presenting the photo-interpretation process, the notions of geometric correction of aerial images and the geodesy elements required for the use of a geographic information system (GIS).
Students are led to carry out a diachronic mapping of land use and land cover changes of a site of their choice, using [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org) and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org).

### Modelling and simulation of changes

**2018, 2019** · 6 hours · [UT2J](https://geo.univ-tlse2.fr/accueil-geo/accueil-departement-de-geographie-amenagement-et-environnement-9905.kjsp) M2, Toulouse (France)

Introduction to agent-based modelling. Complexity theory, complex systems and the systemic approach are presented to the students.
I then present to the students the agent-based model that I developed during my Master's degree to study residential choice and social division of space in Marseille.
Finally, I guide the students in the step-by-step programming of a [Schelling model](https://doi.org/10.1080/0022250X.1971.9989794) with the [ GAMA](https://gama-platform.github.io/) platform.

### *Taller SIG y Modelado*

**2019** · 10 hours · [UEA](https://www.uea.edu.ec/) L3, Puyo (Ecuador).

Lectures in Spanish at the *Universitad Estatal Amazonica* de Puyo: introducing the use of GIS and remote sensing for environmental monitoring, methods for prospective modelling of land use and land cover changes.
