  title: Romain Mejean - Geographer
---

I am a geographer, I specialize in **modelling and simulation of spatial complex systems**.

More broadly, I am interested in modelling practices in Geography, agent-based models, Environmental Geography, foresight approaches and land use and land cover change (LUCC).

I am currently a PhD student and Lecturer Assistant in Geography at [UT2 Jean Jaur√®s](https://www.univ-tlse2.fr/) and [GEODE lab.](http://w3.geode.univ-tlse2.fr), [<span style="color:#cd5ec0">Toulouse</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toulouse) (France).

[My thesis](http://www.theses.fr/s205382) focuses on the land use and land cover changes modelling in the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon.
